This is a social media app built using ionic 4.

### For setting Angular and ionic (frontend) :

* Install Node.js for interacting with the Ionic ecosystem. [Download the LTS version here.](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* If on Windows, open Powershell and run ```npm install @ionic/cli native-run cordova-res```. This will install ionic within the scope (not globally. If you wish to do so, add ```-g``` flag in the above command and run it as ```sudo``` in Linux and in Windows use Amdin mode in Powerrshell).
* Clone the project in desired directory by running ```git clone https://github.com/codedamn/social-media-app-ionic4.git ```.
* Change directory to Project Directory using ```cd Social-media-app```.
* Now run ```npm i```.
